### 💡 Why We Built This

As developers, we use online tools daily but worry about:

- Privacy: Is my data being stored?
- Reliability: Will this tool be here tomorrow?
- Speed: Why is it so slow?

Web Toolkit solves all three. It's fast, private, and open source.

## Maker's Comment

```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I built Web Toolkit because I was frustrated with existing online developer tools. Every time I needed to decode a JWT or format JSON, I worried about where my data was going.

Web Toolkit is different:
✅ 100% client-side – your data never leaves your browser
✅ No signup or account required
✅ Works offline (it's a PWA!)
✅ Open source

I've been using it daily for months, and I hope you find it useful too.

Would love to hear your feedback – what tools would you like to see added?

Thanks for checking it out! 🙏

Title: I built 28+ free developer tools that run entirely in your browser

Hey everyone!

I just launched Web Toolkit - a collection of developer tools that process everything client-side. No signup, no server uploads, no tracking.

Tools include:
- JSON/SQL Formatter
- JWT Decoder
- QR Code Generator
- Base64 Converter
- Hash Generator
- And 20+ more...

Why I built this:
I was tired of worrying about where my data goes when using online tools. With Web Toolkit, everything stays in your browser.

It's also a PWA, so it works offline!

Would love your feedback: https://web-toolkit.app

[I'm not asking for upvotes, just genuine feedback!]
